    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.
